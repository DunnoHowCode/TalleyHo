    <p>^ This is a 100% real sloth, from a real picture. <br> No he is not from a movie made for children. Why would you think that?</p>
    <h2>What are Sloths Known for?</h2>
    <p>Sloths are mostly recognized for two things. In order, it is:
    <ol>
        <li>Sid, because who doesn't know Sid.</li>
        <li>Being extremely sluggish.</li>
    </ol>
    Sloths are just some cool creatures.
    </p>
    <h3>What do they do?</h3>
    <p>They really just be chilling.</p>
    <h4> What do they eat?</h4>
    <p>Sloths are <strong>herbivores,</strong> meaning their diets mostly include plants. That said, they eat other food items as well, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruit</li>
        <li>Insects</li>
        <li>Bird eggs</li>
        <li>Lizards</li>
    </ul>
